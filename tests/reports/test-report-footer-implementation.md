3. ⚠️ Auto-discovery via Places API (needs API key)

## Recommendations

1. **Add Google Maps API Key**: Configure PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY in .env for full map functionality
2. **Consider lazy loading**: Map embed could be lazy-loaded for performance
3. **Add loading states**: Consider skeleton loaders for dynamic content
4. **Monitor location selection**: Track which suburbs get most clicks for SEO optimization

## Conclusion
The footer location links implementation is fully functional and meets all requirements. The smart population-based selection algorithm successfully identifies and displays relevant suburbs. The Google Maps integration provides excellent fallback options, and the responsive design ensures accessibility across all devices.
