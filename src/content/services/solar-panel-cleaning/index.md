### Why Solar Panels Need Professional Cleaning

Many homeowners don't realize how much dirt and grime affects solar panel performance:

- **Efficiency Loss**: Dirty panels can lose 20-30% of their generating capacity
- **Hot Spots**: Partial shading from dirt can create damaging hot spots
- **Warranty Requirements**: Some manufacturers require regular cleaning
- **ROI Impact**: Reduced output means longer payback periods

Professional cleaning is essential for maintaining optimal performance.

## What Reduces Solar Panel Efficiency?

[two-column image="/images/solar-panel-cleaning/panel-contaminants.jpg" position="left"]
### Environmental Contaminants
The Gold Coast's environment presents unique challenges:
- Dust and dirt accumulation
- Pollen and tree sap
- Bird droppings (particularly problematic)
- Lichen and moss growth on edges
- Salt deposits in coastal areas
- Air pollution residue

Each contaminant blocks sunlight and reduces your panels' ability to generate power.

### The Hidden Cost of Dirty Panels
A typical 6.6kW residential system losing 25% efficiency due to dirt could mean:
- Loss of up to 1.65kW generating capacity
- Reduced feed-in tariff earnings
- Increased reliance on grid power
- Extended system payback period

**You could be losing $500-800 per year** from dirty solar panels alone!
