### Why Tile Roofs Need Professional Cleaning

Tile roofs are particularly susceptible to organic growth due to their porous nature and the gaps between tiles where moisture can collect. Common issues we address include:

- **Moss and Lichen Growth**: These organisms can lift tiles and cause water ingress
- **Black Streaks and Stains**: Caused by algae and environmental pollutants
- **Dirt and Debris Buildup**: Accumulates in valleys and between tiles
- **Blocked Gutters**: From debris washing off neglected roofs

Our professional cleaning service addresses all these issues safely and effectively.
